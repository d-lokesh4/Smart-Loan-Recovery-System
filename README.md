## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The **Smart Loan Recovery System** predicts whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan using key financial and demographic features. It helps banks and NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) prioritize high-risk customers and personalize recovery strategies. The backend ML model is integrated with an interactive Flask-based web UI.
